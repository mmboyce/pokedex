# Pokédex
This app is a functional pokedex! It makes calls to [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch information about every pokemon stored on its API. 

On the app, every pokemon is listed in the sidebar to the left, and you can click on their names to redirect to that entry in the pokedex.

Additionally, navigational buttons are present to help you traverse one by one through the Pokédex.

Lastly, you can enter the name of any Pokémon into the search bar at the top of the page to navigate even quicker! If you can't
remember the name of a Pokémon, that's ok too, because the autocomplete will assist you greatly.

The app will remember where you left off too, as it keeps track
of the Pokémon you were viewing when your last session ended, as well as what you had entered in the search box.
